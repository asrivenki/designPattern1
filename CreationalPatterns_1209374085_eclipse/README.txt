The project needs to be run using "Eclipse"
1)Unzip the zip file into a folder. 
2)There will be two subfolders.  
3)Import the jar files under the "JARS" folder into the project.
4)The Folder CreationalPatterns_1209374085_eclipse contains the class files,input files and output files of the project
4)The main function is present in "calculateGradeForStudents.java". Run the calculateGradeForStudents.java. 
calculateGrades g1= c1.getStudentType("undergraduate");
The function getStudentType("argument") is an abstract factory method. The "argument" to the function will determine the student type
The value "undergraduate" to the "argument" will calculate Grade for the undergraduate student from the JSON file "undergraduate.json" under the folder CreationalPatterns_1209374085_eclipse .
The value "graduate" to the "argument"  will calculate Grade for the undergraduate student from the JSON file "graduate.xml" under the folder CreationalPatterns_1209374085_eclipse .   

The output type of the file is generated by the outputGrades function of calculateGrades .
Please provide the output type as the argument to the function outputGrades("xml").
